# KITT – AI Enablement for BOD

KITT is an AI enabler team in BOD.  
This repository collects code, templates and examples that help teams in Digdir experiment with and use AI **safely, practically and in line with our policies**.

---

## What is this repo for?

This repo exists to:

- Help teams go from **“I have an idea for AI”** to **a small, safe experiment or pilot**
- Share **reusable building blocks** (code, patterns, templates)
- Show **good examples** of AI solutions that follow Digdir’s KI policies and guidelines
- Make it easier to **do things right once**, and then reuse across teams

You don’t need to be an AI expert to use this repo.

---

## Who is it for?

- **Developers** – who want code examples, patterns and reference implementations  
- **Product owners / designers** – who want to understand what is possible and how to start small  
- **Architects / tech leads** – who care about security, data, and how AI fits into the bigger picture  
- **Leaders and advisors** – who want to see concrete, policy-aligned AI examples

---

## What you’ll find here

The exact structure will evolve, but you can expect folders like:

- `examples/` – Small, focused AI examples  
  - e.g. simple RAG demos, agents with tools, prompt patterns
- `templates/` – Starter kits and boilerplates  
  - project templates, config examples, checklists
- `guides/` – Short “how to” documents  
  - how to start an AI experiment, how to think about risk, data and privacy
- `infra/` – Infrastructure-related snippets  
  - CI/CD examples, MLOps, monitoring and logging patterns

Check the folder `README` files for more details.

---

##  Getting started

1. **Browse the examples**  
   Go to `examples/` and find something close to what you want to do.

2. **Read the guide**  
   In `guides/` you’ll find short texts on:
   - how to start an AI initiative,
   - how to document your use case,
   - what to think about regarding data, risk and policy.

3. **Reuse before you reinvent**  
   If a template or example fits 70–80% of your need, start there and adapt it.

4. **Talk to KITT**  
   If you’re unsure what to choose, or whether your idea is safe and realistic, contact the KITT team.

##  Responsible use of AI

All work in this repo should:

- Follow Digdir’s KI policies and guidelines  
- Respect privacy, security and data classification  
- Make it possible to **explain** what the AI solution does and why  
- Be realistic to run in production (not only a nice demo)

If you see something that does **not** follow this, please raise an issue or contact KITT.

## Contributing

We want this repo to be a **shared toolbox** for BOD.

You can contribute by:

- Adding or improving examples
- Writing short guides based on your project experience
- Reporting issues or improvement ideas

Please:

1. Open an issue first if you plan a larger change  
2. Make sure your contribution follows our KI policies  
3. Add a short `README` in any new folder explaining what it is and how to use it

## Contact

If you want help with an AI idea, or are unsure how to use anything here:

- Contact the **KITT team** (BOD) on our usual channels  
- Or open an issue in this repository

KITT is here to help you **use AI safely, effectively and with as little friction as possible.**# team-kitt
